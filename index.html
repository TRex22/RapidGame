<p>This is my attempt at migrating RapidXNA made by <a href="https://github.com/edg3" class="user-mention">@edg3</a> to GitHub,
Upgrading it to work with MonoGame, and also getting it to work 
in its 2.0 Alpha version with XNA.</p>

<h2>
<a name="about-rapidxna-1" class="anchor" href="#about-rapidxna-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About RapidXNA</h2>

<p>A simple framework that aims to make starting up new XNA projects for Windows, 
Xbox 360 and Windows Phone 7 easier. Using RapidXNA you should be able to 
easily port between the 3 platforms with only minor code changes to your projects.</p>

<h2>
<a name="news" class="anchor" href="#news"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>News:</h2>

<p>RapidXNA 2.0 Alpha is available (it was meant to mimic functionality of 
RapidXNA 1 for now. If someone can confirm that RapidXNA 1 works on XBOX I can 
move it from Beta to Final release and focus on development of RapidXNA 2.0 that 
will hopefully in the end support Windows, Mac, Linux, Windows Phone 7, and Xbox 360. 
Furthermore, after RapidXNA 2.0 Release is ready I would like to look into extending to 
include Android and iOS eventually (if possible).</p>

<p>RapidXNA 2.0 worked out well, and much easier to use for the game development during 
Ludum Dare than I could have hoped for, but once again I got stumped by the Visual Studio 
built-in functions for creating "copy for" Windows Phone and the problem most likely propogates 
to the Xbox 360 version, so after some thought and sleep Im going to stop development of 
RapidXNA in favour of building a system that works in a unified way for 2D game dev on all 
platforms I want to support. I will post more about it when I get what I want to do right.</p>

<p><del>The RapidXNA 1 and 2.0 code will remain here though I will most probably not actively ~~
~~do development on the code any more. Should anyone want to take over the dev of RapidXNA ~~
~~send me a message/email and I can hand over project ownership.</del></p>

<p>Notes:
Please refer the the documentation for examples on how to use the framework.</p>

<p>How to use RapidXNA
1. Set up the project</p>

<pre><code>Add a reference to the .dll that corresponds with your current project
    Windows: RapidXNA.dll
    Xbox 360: RapidXNA360.dll
    Windows Phone 7: RapidXNAWP7.dll (supports Mango, 7.1 only)
Remove the SpriteBatch related code and variables from Game1.cs
Create a variable of type RapidXNA.RapidEngine, instantiate it in the LoadContent() method in your Game1.cs
Add an Update call to your Update() method in Game1.cs for your instance of RapidXNA.RapidEngine's Update()
Add a Draw call to your Draw() method in Game1.cs for your instance of RapidXNA.RapidEngine's Draw()
Create a new class for your initial game screen (or state if you prefer) and inherit from RapidXNA.DataType.IGameScreen
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Using "game screens"
Each IGameScreen has overridable Load, Draw and Update methods, that correspond directly to the methods in your usual Game1.cs code. These are all called automatically in the background by the RapidEngine. They also each have a reference to Engine.</li>
</ol><p>Using the ScreenService
3. Using Services
RapidXNA calls the major reusable classes that you would usually only need one instance of a "service". The engine will update and draw all services (so if you want to write an in app console you would most probably make it a service. You can write your own services by inheriting from IRapidService.</p>

<p>Using general Services
Features
This list is a work in progress</p>

<pre><code>Game state management via "screens"
Asynchronous screen loading
Built in Keyboard, GamePad and Mouse wrapping (Phone touch input wrapping in planning).
</code></pre>

<p>Structure
Overview of the major classes:</p>

<pre><code>How about a project template(s) in the download, for even more rapid XNA, as well as class templates.

<pre><code>Project templates make sense. What class templates do you think would make sense?
