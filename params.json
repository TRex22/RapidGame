{"name":"RapidGame","tagline":"https://rapidxna.codeplex.com","body":"RapidGame\r\n========\r\n@edg3\r\n\r\nhttps://rapidxna.codeplex.com for original SVN\r\n\r\nAbout RapidGame\r\n==============\r\nThis is my attempt at migrating RapidXNA made by @edg3 to GitHub,\r\nUpgrading it to work with MonoGame, and also getting it to work \r\nin its 2.0 Alpha version with XNA, since I dont think that version\r\nwas functional.\r\n\r\nReleases\r\n========\r\nThey are found at:\r\nhttp://TRex22.github.io/RapidGame/Releases\r\n\r\nThere are preliminary releases which are perhaps kind of useless, they are\r\nuntested but released so that if they are needed they may be used.\r\n\r\nProject Specifications\r\n======================\r\nReleases will be stored on the gh-pages.\r\n\r\nAll new code is pushed to develop and pull/merge requests sent for\r\n\tmerging with master.\r\nOther changes can get their own branches\r\nThis follows a successful git branching model discussed here:\r\n\thttp://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\r\n\r\nThe static information page will be used for the developer wiki,\r\nfeeds and general information stuff.\r\nThis will only be implemented when I have done that project\r\n(It is another project of mine, to build a boilerplate for gh-pages)\r\nFor now the built in GitHub wiki will be used.\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome, but first I would like prospective contributers\r\nto either create their own branch (after sending me a message) or fork the\r\nproject and then contribute. Afterwards send pull/merge requests to develop.\r\n\r\nMilestones\r\n==========\r\n\r\nMilestone 1\r\n-----------\r\nThe first milestone of the project is to setup a function project outline,\r\ncomplete the RapidXNA 2 Alpha and complete the migration from the SVN repo.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo Effectively Load and Build the Source or a Project\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nRapidXNA requires XNA Game Studio, Visual Studio (c#) 2010 and Windows Phone \r\nsdk 7.\r\n\r\nRapidGame and Mono Related projects will require MonoGame 3 for VS 2012, \r\nalthough MonoDevelop could also be used if desired. Also the Mono SDK is needed.\r\n\r\nTo Run a Project\r\n----------------\r\nRapidXNA Requires the XNA Redistributable for Windows.\r\nRapidGame will require OpenAl, and other related Redistributables, such\r\nas DirectX, OpenGL, Unity ect...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
