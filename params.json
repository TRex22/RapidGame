Set up the project\r\n\r\n    Add a reference to the .dll that corresponds with your current project\r\n        Windows: RapidXNA.dll\r\n        Xbox 360: RapidXNA360.dll\r\n        Windows Phone 7: RapidXNAWP7.dll (supports Mango, 7.1 only)\r\n    Remove the SpriteBatch related code and variables from Game1.cs\r\n    Create a variable of type RapidXNA.RapidEngine, instantiate it in the LoadContent() method in your Game1.cs\r\n    Add an Update call to your Update() method in Game1.cs for your instance of RapidXNA.RapidEngine's Update()\r\n    Add a Draw call to your Draw() method in Game1.cs for your instance of RapidXNA.RapidEngine's Draw()\r\n    Create a new class for your initial game screen (or state if you prefer) and inherit from RapidXNA.DataType.IGameScreen\r\n\r\n2. Using \"game screens\"\r\nEach IGameScreen has overridable Load, Draw and Update methods, that correspond directly to the methods in your usual Game1.cs code. These are all called automatically in the background by the RapidEngine. They also each have a reference to Engine.\r\n\r\nUsing the ScreenService\r\n3. Using Services\r\nRapidXNA calls the major reusable classes that you would usually only need one instance of a \"service\". The engine will update and draw all services (so if you want to write an in app console you would most probably make it a service. You can write your own services by inheriting from IRapidService.\r\n\r\nUsing general Services\r\nFeatures\r\nThis list is a work in progress\r\n\r\n    Game state management via \"screens\"\r\n    Asynchronous screen loading\r\n    Built in Keyboard, GamePad and Mouse wrapping (Phone touch input wrapping in planning).\r\n\r\nStructure\r\nOverview of the major classes:\r\n\r\n![alt tag](http://i40.tinypic.com/34qpooi.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussions From Codeplex\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nSuggestions \r\n-----------\r\n\r\n Wiki Link: [discussion:285185]\r\nedg3\r\nCoordinator\r\nJan 6, 2012 at 9:46 AM\r\n\r\n\tPlease post all suggestions you have for addition to the framework here.\r\n\t\r\nlancejz\r\nApr 17, 2012 at 12:43 AM\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tHow about a project template(s) in the download, for even more rapid XNA, as well as class templates.\r\n\t\r\nedg3\r\nCoordinator\r\nApr 17, 2012 at 6:49 AM\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tProject templates make sense. What class templates do you think would make sense?\r\n\r\nCodePlex Issues\r\n===============\r\n\r\nLoading wait time\r\n-----------------\r\nAdd in a way to add a static loading screen image for when loading a new screen, or a game screen to draw/update when currently loading.\r\n\r\nId #1000 | Release: None | Updated: Feb 1, 2013 at 6:01 AM by edg3 | Created: Jan 30, 2012 at 11:45 AM by edg3\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
