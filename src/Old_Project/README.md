Old_Project
===========

This is parts of an old project I am resurrecting.
The SDL here was taken from an even older project of mine and slightly optimised.
I want to try and salvage that code and convert it to run on C#
The basic screen will just display one screen matrix as an initial test.

This code here wont function in this state. It is here for reference only.
Also This code is SDL version 1

The one project can be found:
