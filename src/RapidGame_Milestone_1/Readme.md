This will be the base code of RapidGame based off the two RapidXNA V2 srcs.
Those sources seem divergent so their code must be merge into one functional build.

TODO
====

	- Create Linux build project file (Will have to run on a build agent, linux server)
	- Create a windows phone 8 VS project
	- Migrate existing VS projects to either VS 2012 or 2013
	- Remove old code, its on a specific branch
