About RapidGame
==============
This is my attempt at migrating RapidXNA made by @edg3 (Ernest Loveland) to GitHub,
Upgrading it to work with MonoGame and to eventually have its own 
rendering, audio and other frameworks.

Releases
========
They are found at:
https://github.com/TRex22/RapidGame/releases

RapidXNA
========
RapidXNA was a similar idea whose codebase spawned what is now RapidGame.
Its source code was used with (@edg3's permission) to help build this project.
That code has its own branches in this repo. 

Milestones
==========

Milestone 3
-----------
Begin to develop RapidGame from the ground up whilst still using some 
code from the RapidXNA 3.0 Alpha codebase. 
This will be the rough design where the core abstraction layers are defined and loosely built. 
It will be a rough alpha version.

Milestone 4
-----------
This will be the cleanup phase of the alpha build of RapidGame. 
There may also be some experiments with SDL and other technologies such as Java. 
A functional version of the C# RapidGame should be released here. 
Some basic test games and demos should be built as well. (Might become its own milestone)

Requirements
============

To Effectively Load and Build the Source or a Project
-----------------------------------------------------
RapidGame and Mono Related projects will require MonoGame 3 for VS 2012, 
although MonoDevelop could also be used if desired. Also the Mono SDK is needed.

To Run a Project
----------------
RapidXNA Requires the XNA Redistributable for Windows.
RapidGame will require OpenAl, and other related Redistributables, such
as DirectX, OpenGL, Unity ect...
